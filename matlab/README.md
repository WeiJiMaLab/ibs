This folder contains MATLAB implementations and examples of IBS; see the [home page](https://github.com/lacerbi/ibs) for general information.

## Code

- `ibslike.m` is an advanced vectorized implementation of IBS, which supports several advanced features (still work in progress). Read the documentation in the file for usage information.

We will soon add worked tutorials and examples for how to apply IBS. Stay tuned!
