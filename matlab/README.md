# Inverse binomial sampling (IBS) for MATLAB

This folder contains MATLAB implementations and examples of IBS; see the [home page](https://github.com/lacerbi/ibs) for general information.

## Code

- `ibslike.m` is an advanced vectorized implementation of IBS, which supports several advanced features (still work in progress). Read the documentation in the file for usage information. ibslike returns the *negative* log-likelihood as it is meant to be used with an optimization method such as Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search ([BADS](https://github.com/lacerbi/bads)).

We will soon add worked tutorials and examples for how to apply IBS. Stay tuned!
