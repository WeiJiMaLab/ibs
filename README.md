# Inverse binomial sampling (IBS)

## What is it

IBS is a technique to obtain unbiased, efficient estimates of the log-likelihood of a model by simulation. [[1](#references),[2](#references)]

The typical scenario is the case in which you have an *implicit* model from which you can randomly draw synthetic observations (for a given parameter vector), but cannot evaluate the log-likelihood analytically or numerically. In other words, IBS affords likelihood-based inference for likelihood-free models.

If you use IBS in conjunction with [Bayesian Adaptive Direct Search](https://github.com/lacerbi/bads) (as recommended in the paper), you could add
